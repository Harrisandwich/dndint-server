## Contributing


Here's the basic process for contributing

- Check issues and the MVP project to see what is in the pipe.

- Check with me (Harrisandwich) about the status of the issue or item 

- Create a new branch for the issue

- When done, create a pull request for review and merge

I've never done anything like this before, so things may change if this repo gets any attention
